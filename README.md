# Bajaj-finserv-java-task-springboot-SQL
The goal of the application is to simulate a hands-free backend workflow that interacts with two remote APIs, processes a SQL-based data problem, and submits the final SQL solution using a JWT-secured webhook. The solution is implemented using Spring Boot, Maven, and RestTemplate, ensuring reliability, modularity, and clean code structure.
